## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  
My initial idea was to have a clock with three 'areas' (representiung hours, minutes and seconds) and a different living thing would be assigned to each of these areas. The living thing would have a lifespan or life cycle of some description that would correspond with the amount of time that it represented. For example; I have 3 kinds of bugs, one of the bugs has an average lifespan of a second so every second, one of these bugs would crawl onto the screen and die in the 'seconds' area. Another one of the bugs has an average lifespan of 1 minute so every minute, one of these bugs would fly over and die into the 'minutes' area and so on and so forth. This would create a pile of dead bugs in each area which you could then count to work out the time. However I am not so sure about this idea anymore because I cannot find any living thing that only lives for a second.

My second idea as shown in 'sketch.jpg' and 'preview.jpg' uses cars as the inspiration. The seconds are represented by a 'RPM' gauge where the needle will increase by one every second until it gets to 60 where it will go back to zero and start again. At that point the minutes represented by a 'KMH' gauge will go up by 1. Once the kmh gauge reaches 60 it will reset to zero and the vehicle will shift gears as seen on the far left. The gear shifter represents hours and there are 12 gears (it may not be very realistic but semi-trucks have 12 gears so its not too ridiculous.) I also added a 'AM/PM' switch which shows whether it is AM or PM and will change every 12 hours. Once the vehicle has gone through all 12 gears it will go back to first gear. You can read my clock just like any regular clock. For example if the vehicle is in 3rd gear with the switch on 'PM', going 32kmh at 1000RPM then the time is 3:32.10PM
